# cssCollapse
A simple jQuery plugin that collapse boxes of content using CSS3

This plugin, obviously, does not show the slide of the hidden boxes on older browsers like Internet Explorer 7/8/9 because they does not support the CSS 3 transitions rule
The behaviour on these browsers will be a simple hide/show of the hidden content

TO DO:
- example with icon changes
- user customization
